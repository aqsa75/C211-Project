Contributors:  Aqsa Shabbir, Lex Hahn, Austin Cox


Description: Our Project is going to be a game that is designed to ask the user a series of questions in order to get their likes/dislikes. After asking them a series of questions, we will suggest for them a travel destination that they should consider traveling to given their answers to the questions. 

Classes to be added:
            - class with array holding question and answers        [ LEX ]
            - class that creates a new form in javafx for the quiz    [ AUSTIN ]
            - class that updates the quiz and increases the score       [ AQSA ]
            - classes for each individual 'button' on javax with if statement
