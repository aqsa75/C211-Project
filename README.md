Title: Where Should You Travel?
  
  
Contributors:  Aqsa Shabbir


Description/Aim: My Project is going to be a game that is designed to ask the user a series of questions in order to get their likes/dislikes. After asking them a series of questions, we will suggest for them a travel destination that they should consider traveling to given their answers to the questions. 

The GUI is composed of the question title, and then buttons for each of the two possible answers. Once the answer is selected, it will bring the user to the next question. After answering the ten questions, another screen will open with the selected travel destination for the user. When clicking on certain answer choices, you might notice the score in the bottom corner increment which helps us in determining a destination to assign to you.
