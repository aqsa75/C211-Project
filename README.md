Contributors:  Aqsa Shabbir, Lex Hahn, Austin Cox


Description/Aim: Our Project is going to be a game that is designed to ask the user a series of questions in order to get their likes/dislikes. After asking them a series of questions, we will suggest for them a travel destination that they should consider traveling to given their answers to the questions. 

Interface functionality: this is a quiz that is made up of two buttons with answer choices to questions. The user is to click on whatever choice they would like to go with an they will automatically be directed to the next screen. After answering the ten questions, another screen will open with the selected travel destination for the user. When clicking on certain answer choices, you might notice the score in the bottom corner increment which helps us in determining a destination to assign to you. 

Source File: newquiz.java --> this is where all of our code is placed and is important as it determines functionality of the game.
